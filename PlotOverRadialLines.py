# This script gets loaded as a Macro in Paraview, then you select the loaded
#   time-series Intensity volume data in the Pipeline Browser and run the Macro
# It probes the volume data Intensity field along lines starting at 0,0,0 and ending
#   distributed fairly evenly over the surface of the sphere, over all time points
# Output is a tidy-format CSV file with intensities, point coordinates,
#   and time, line, and point indices
# The goal is to create 1D curves that can be analyzed to detect peaks in intensity
#   which could result in point clouds over intensity peak surfaces

# Change the sphere radius such that the sphere will cover the whole volume.
# You can also set the line resolution which will change the resolution of the probed data
#   and the number of points covering the sphere

# Basic plot over line saving learned from this video:
#   Automate plot over line using python script in paraview
#   https://youtu.be/7lqYJxmp4_4

# Generate points on sphere
# This script generates a points fairly evenly spaced on a sphere
